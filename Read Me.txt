To edit the board and certain spaces go over to the Board.txt file and play around with that.

The first part on each line should be the color followed by any special characteristics that space has, and
if it does then the third part would be an int telling the user how many spaces they need to go back.

The program creates the board from the .txt file and then the player can use the random number generator to roll the 4 sided die.
On the die 1 = BLUE  2 = RED  3 = ORAGNE  4 = GREEN
